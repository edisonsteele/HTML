# HTML: Your One-Stop Resource Hub

Hello there! üëã This is **Edisonic's** HTML hub.

Upon learning more and more about HTML, I realized that many guides lack a central repository of the diverse resources beginners often require. My goal is to build this repository into a comprehensive "one-stop shop" for anyone learning or working with HTML, from absolute beginners to seasoned developers. We'll focus primarily on **HTML5** but aim to stay current as the language evolves!

## üéØ Purpose

The core mission of this repository is to:

1.  **Aggregate:** Collect high-quality HTML resources, code snippets, examples, and links in one place.
2.  **Organize:** Structure information logically, making it easy to find what you need.
3.  **Simplify:** Provide clear explanations and practical examples, especially for foundational concepts.
4.  **Support:** Offer a reliable reference point for developers of all skill levels.

## üìö What You'll Find Inside (Planned & In Progress)

This repository aims to include:

* **Fundamentals:** Clear explanations and examples of basic tags, attributes, and document structure.
* **Semantic HTML:** Guides on using tags for meaning (e.g., `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`) and why it matters.
* **Forms:** Comprehensive examples of different input types, validation, and best practices.
* **Media:** How to embed images, audio, and video effectively.
* **Accessibility (a11y):** Tips and techniques for writing inclusive HTML that works for everyone.
* **HTML5 APIs:** Snippets and explanations for features like Canvas, Geolocation, Web Storage, etc.
* **Best Practices:** Conventions for clean, maintainable, and efficient HTML code.
* **Common Snippets:** Ready-to-use code blocks for frequent patterns (e.g., navigation bars, cards, footers).
* **Links to External Resources:** Curated links to excellent tutorials, documentation (like MDN Web Docs), tools, and validators.
* **Boilerplates:** Simple starting templates for different types of HTML projects.

*(This section will grow and become more specific as content is added!)*
